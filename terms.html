        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Pepper Factory Apps</p>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: December 28, 2024</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using any mobile application operated by Deokhwa Lee ("us", "we", or "our"), including OneThing, Habit, BulkUp, and AdMob Tracker (collectively, the "Services").</p>

        <p>By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you do not have permission to use the Services.</p>

        <h2>1. Use of Services</h2>
        <p>Our Services are provided for personal, non-commercial use. You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Some of our apps offer premium features through subscriptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions are billed through Apple App Store</li>
            <li>Billing cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled before the end of the current billing period</li>
            <li>You may cancel your subscription through your iTunes account settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>We may modify subscription fees at any time. Changes become effective at the end of the current billing cycle. Continued use after a fee change constitutes acceptance of the new fee.</p>

        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>Except when required by law, subscription fees are non-refundable. Refund requests should be directed to Apple through the App Store.</p>

        <h2>3. HealthKit Integration (BulkUp)</h2>
        <p>BulkUp offers optional integration with Apple HealthKit. This requires your explicit permission and can be disabled at any time. We only write workout data to HealthKit; we do not read other health data.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services (AdMob Tracker)</h2>
        <p>AdMob Tracker requires Google Sign-In to access your AdMob revenue data. By using this app, you authorize access to your AdMob account information. This app is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google.</p>

        <h2>5. Content</h2>
        <p>You retain all rights to any content you create within our Services (tasks, habits, workout records, etc.). You are responsible for the content you create and its legality.</p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Services and their original content, features, and functionality are the exclusive property of Deokhwa Lee and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>

        <h2>7. Health Disclaimer (BulkUp)</h2>
        <p>BulkUp is designed to help track workouts and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Consult your physician before beginning any exercise program. We are not responsible for any injuries or health issues resulting from your workouts.</p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall Deokhwa Lee be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or other intangible losses, resulting from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your use or inability to use the Services</li>
            <li>Any conduct or content of third parties</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access to your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Services are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Services immediately, without prior notice, for any breach of these Terms. You may terminate your use by simply uninstalling the app.</p>

        <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
