        <h1>Terms of Use ("Terms")</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: December 28, 2024</em></p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the OneThing mobile application (the "Service") operated by Deokhwa Lee ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

        <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis.</p>

        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Deokhwa Lee cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your iTunes account management page or by contacting Apple, Inc customer support team.</p>

        <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>Deokhwa Lee, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

        <p>Deokhwa Lee will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. Refund requests should be directed to Apple, Inc. through the App Store.</p>

        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>Our Service allows you to store and manage certain information, including timer records, to-do lists, and D-Day events ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you create within the Service.</p>

        <p>You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you create within the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights.</p>

        <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>The Service and its original content, features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Deokhwa Lee and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the Republic of Korea and foreign countries.</p>

        <h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Deokhwa Lee.</p>

        <p>Deokhwa Lee has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.</p>

        <h3>Termination</h3>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>

        <p>If you wish to terminate your use of the Service, you may simply discontinue using the Service and uninstall the app.</p>

        <h3>Limitation Of Liability</h3>
        <p>In no event shall Deokhwa Lee, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content.</p>

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.</p>

        <h3>Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Republic of Korea, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
